	Description:

	An Architecture Decision Record example template: 
		Date
		Decision makers [who was involved in the decision taken]
		Category [which part of the architecture does this decision pertain to]
		Contextual outline [Explain why this decision was made. Outline the key considerations and assumptions at play]
		Impact consequences [What does this decision mean for the project? What should someone reading this be aware of in terms of future decisions?]
